# CAIRS Repo

Welcome to the Sasquatch CAIRS GitHub Repository.

## Branch Setup
- **master** - The master branch. Needs to be pushed according to specific procedure; see below.
- **site** - Contains the website.
- **brand** - Contains the Sasquatch/CAIRS Branding Documents.
- **dev/** ***name*** - Development Branch for Misc. (non-Feature) work. Replace *name* with your name.
- **feature/** ***name*** - Development Branch for Feature work. Replace *name* with the feature's name.

## Pushing to master
Merging to master should be done very rarely, after approval from the team.

For major feature work:
- Make sure everything you want to merge is in your branch (and reviewed).
- Ensure that all tests are passing and that you haven't broken functionality.
- Bring up the merge at a team meeting.
- Once approved at the meeting, a *Pull Request* will be created for the merge.
- The Pull Request will be approved with the date of the meeting as the Approval Notes and merged through GitHub's automatic merging.
 
For minor/configuration work:
- Get a shipit for the work.
- Click on the *Pull Request* button to initiate a request. Make sure only the proper commit is selected. If needed, create a new branch with just that request or rebase your changes.
- On the right-hand side, choose your branch as the "head branch".
- Add in a description of the change, and why it needs to be pushed to master.
- Wait for **3 approvals** (separate from your ShipIts, but it can be the same people who approved your review).
- After you're done, click "Merge Pull Request", give it a description, and click "Confirm Merge".
